# Description
* Air Hockey is an arcade game for two players. Where two opposing players try to score goals against each other. Each player has their own striker, which is used to hit the puck.

* The blue striker is controlled by WASD, the red by arrows. The purpose of the game is to score more goals than your opponent. The game ends when one of the players scores the required number of goals or when the time is up, according to the established rules before the game. In my version, in the settings, we choose one of the four possibilities for the game's end. Two are related to time, and the other two are related to the maximum number of goals. We can choose from 5 or 7 points, or 2 or 3 minutes.

* A key aspect of implementation was handling collisions: puck and strikers with the table frame, puck with strikers and puck with the goal area.
